Limak has a string S, that consists of N lowercase English letters. Limak then created a new string by repeating S exactly K times. For example, for S = "abcb" and K = 2, he would 
get "abcbabcb".

Your task is to count the number of subsequences "ab" (not necessarily consecutive) in the new string.

In other words, find the number pairs of indices i < j, such that the i-th and j-th characters in the new string are 'a' and 'b' respectively.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K, denoting the length of the initial string S and the number of repetitions respectively.

The second line contains a string S. Its length is exactly N, and each of its characters is a lowercase English letter.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the number of subsequences "ab" in the new string. For the given constraints, it can be proved that the answer fits 
in the 64-bit signed type.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ N * K ≤ 10^9 (in other words, the new string has length up to 10^9)

Example
Input:
3
4 2
abcb
7 1
aayzbaa
12 80123123
abzbabzbazab

Output:
6
2
64197148392731290

Explanation
Test case 1. Limak repeated the string "abcb" 2 times, and so he got "abcbabcb". There are 6 occurrences of the subsequence "ab":

ABcbabcb (the two letters marked uppercase)
AbcBabcb
AbcbaBcb
AbcbabcB
abcbABcb
abcbAbcB

Test case 2. Since K = 1, the new string is equal to the given S ("aayzbaa"). There are 2 occurrences of the subsequence "ab" in this string: AayzBaa and aAyzBaa.
